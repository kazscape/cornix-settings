## Moving Between Layers

Swiching between what layer is active can be done in a few ways. In the lower palette, select the **layer** tab to view all the different options.

- MO(Momentary) layer - momentarily activates the layer. As soon as you let go of the key, the layer is deactivated.
- DF(Default) layer - changes which layer is the dafault layer. This stays until the device loses power.
- TG(Toggle) layer - toggles the layer, activating it if it's inactive and vice versa.
- TT(Tap Toggle) layer - If you hold the key down, the layer is activated, and then is de-activated when you let go (like MO). If you repeatedly tap it, the layer will be toggled on or off (like TG). It needs 5 taps to do this.
- OSL(One Shot Layer) layer - momentarily activates the layer until the next key is pressed.
- LT(Layer Tap) layer - momentarily activates the layer when it is held, sends a keycode when pressed. The keycode can be defined like all the other buttons, just select the smaller box insid.
